**GitHub Pages** provides **free web hosting** for blogs and websites. To get started, create a new repository in your GitHub account in the format *yourusername.github.io* and any changes pushed to the repo will appear on your web site.

GitHub suggests using **Jekyll** to generate a static site. Although a little dated, here's a [good post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) by **Joshua Lande** which explains how to get started with Jekyll, the Poole theme and Liquid templates.

Also, be sure to visit the **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages** home pages [here](https://jekyllrb.com) and [here](https://pages.github.com).
